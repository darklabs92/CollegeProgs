# This worked because we already had a tagger already trained on news articles
# Let's check out a way to train our own tagger and evaluate its accuracy
# The first step is to find an annotated corpus of text which is the most closely associated with 
# the problem at hand
# To see an example, let's use a corpus which comes pre-installed with Python NLTK
# The corpus is the famous Brown Corpus which was the first 1 Million word annotated Corpus
# Let's split the corpus into training and testing set for evaluation purposes
# We assign 90% of the corpus for the tagger training

# Now that we are training a tagger on some data, we must be careful not to test it on
# the same data, as we did in the previous example. A tagger that simply memorized its
# training data and made no attempt to construct a general model would get a perfect
# score, but would be useless for tagging new text. Instead, we should split the data,
# training on 90% and testing on the remaining 10%

# Although the score is worse, we now have a better picture of the usefulness of this
# tagger, i.e., its performance on previously unseen text.

# Now we try to see if Bigrams work better

bigram_tagger = nltk.BigramTagger(train_sents)
bigram_tagger.tag(brown_sents[2007])

# We see that the bigram tagger has performed very well indeed, tagging all the words in a sentence which it had encountered before
# Let's evaluate its performance on an unseen sentence

unseen_sent = brown_sents[4203]
bigram_tagger.tag(unseen_sent)

# Notice that the bigram tagger manages to tag every word in a sentence it saw during
# training, but does badly on an unseen sentence. As soon as it encounters a new word
# (i.e., 13.5), it is unable to assign a tag. It cannot tag the following word (i.e., million),
# even if it was seen during training, simply because it never saw it during training with
# a None tag on the previous word. Consequently, the tagger fails to tag the rest of the
# sentence. Its overall accuracy score is very low:

bigram_tagger.evaluate(test_sents)

# As n gets larger, the specificity of the contexts increases, as does the chance that the
# data we wish to tag contains contexts that were not present in the training data. This
# is known as the sparse data problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP. As a consequence,
# there is a trade-off between the accuracy and the coverage of our results (and this is
# related to the precision/recall trade-off in information retrieval)

# The Regex Tagger performs better than the Bigram and the Trigram Taggers

# One way to address the trade-off between accuracy and coverage is to use the more
# accurate algorithms when we can, but to fall back on algorithms with wider coverage
# when necessary. For example, we could combine the results of a bigram tagger, a
# unigram tagger, and a default tagger, as follows

# 1. Try tagging the token with the trigram  tagger.
# 2. If the trigram tagger is unable to find a tag for the token, try the bigram tagger.
# 3. If the bigram tagger is also unable to find a tag, use the unigram tagger.
# 4. If the unigram tagger is also unable to find a tag, use a default tagger.
